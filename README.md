## Front-end Fund Me

**Welcome to the front-end repository of Fund Me, a blockchain-powered fundraising application where users can contribute funds in Ether. This repository contains the codebase for the user interface of the application.**

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Metamask
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript

## Quickstart

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```

2. Run this file

In VSCode you can run it with 'live server'.

After opening the website, you can connect your Metamask wallet. 

If you're running the local anvil blockchain then you have to deploy the fund me contract first and then you should make the transactions.
